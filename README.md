# Energy-Consumption-Tracking-System

The increasing demand for energy, coupled with the diverse sources of
energy consumption—namely oil, nuclear, biomass, biogas, water, solar, coal, and
water—poses significant challenges in accurately predicting energy consumption patterns in
residential and commercial sectors. Current systems often lack real-time monitoring
capabilities, leading to inefficient energy usage and difficulties in identifying areas for
improvement.
Moreover, the fragmentation of data across various sources complicates the analysis and
integration of energy consumption metrics. This results in inadequate visibility into
consumption trends and inefficiencies, which can hinder efforts to optimize energy use and
achieve sustainability goals.
